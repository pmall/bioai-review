## Target

**A review of 49 references, not an exhaustive survey.** There is no word count,
here or anywhere. A draft is as long as what it carries requires; the relative
weights below are the only size constraint, and a section is too long when it
spends prose on material its tier does not warrant, never because it passed a
count.

**Tables A and B are display items**, not main text. Only the paragraph between
them is prose.

## Weight — the rule that governs every other rule here

A review is read for its **proportions** before it is read for its sentences. A
reader who knows this field arrives with a rough map of what matters in it, and
the fastest way to lose them is to spend three paragraphs on a preprint they
have not heard of and one clause on AlphaFold. The tier system exists to prevent
exactly that, and this section is where it becomes an instruction to the writer.

**Tier determines treatment. It is not a hint.**

| Tier         | Treatment in the prose                                                                               | Test the draft must pass                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **backbone** | A passage of its own: mechanism, the numbers that matter, the caveat, and what it is contrasted with | A reader could explain what this system does and why it mattered, from the review alone |
| **meat**     | Named in a sentence or two while a backbone claim is being made; its numbers may be quoted           | Removing it weakens a claim's evidence; it does not leave a hole in the narrative       |
| **mention**  | A clause, or a parenthetical. No mechanism, no numbers in the prose — numbers go to Table A or B     | It can be read past without loss                                                        |

**Twenty publications carry the review.** They are the backbone set, and they
are the ones a reader should come away able to name:

| Section     | Gets a passage                                                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| §1          | AlphaFold2 · AlphaFold-Multimer · AlphaFold3                      |
| §2          | RoseTTAFold · RFdiffusion · RFantibody · RFpeptides · ProteinMPNN |
| §3          | Boltz-1 · BoltzGen · BoltzProt-1                                  |
| §4          | Chai-2                                                            |
| §5          | FrameFlow                                                         |
| §6          | BindCraft · Germinal                                              |
| §7          | PXDesign                                                          |
| §8          | ESM-2/ESMFold · ESMC/ESMFold2 · the ESMFold2 binder campaign      |
| §9          | Latent-X1                                                         |
| Instruments | FoldBench                                                         |

Everything else in `map.md` — roughly thirty further works — appears in support
of a claim or not at all. **That is not a demotion**; the invariant that every
named publication resolves to a catalog entry is about the catalog's honesty,
not about the prose owing each one a turn.

**Three failure modes, in the order they actually happen.**

1. **The recency inversion.** Recent preprints have long, specific, quotable
   entries because they were read most recently and argue with each other in
   detail. Mastodonts have short entries because their content is assumed. A
   draft written by following entry length will invert the field's weight.
   _Check:_ if a 2026 preprint gets more prose than AlphaFold2, RFdiffusion or
   ProteinMPNN, the draft is wrong regardless of how interesting the preprint
   is.
1. **The interesting-detail trap.** A small paper with an unusual result is more
   fun to write about than a foundational one whose result everybody knows.
   Interest is not weight. A finding earns prose in proportion to what rests on
   it, and `map.md` states what rests on each entry under _Carries_.
1. **Cataloguing under the guise of completeness.** Listing five flow-matching
   papers because the corpus holds five. §5's own entry says what to do instead:
   one argument, four examples named in support.

**Where the map over-supplies, cut rather than expand.** Some entries carry more
material than their tier warrants, because the underlying paper is recent and
detailed. The map records what is true; this file decides what is written. When
the two disagree, tier wins.

## Draft units

Two layers: **drafts**, one per map heading, and the **parts** they collapse
into. A draft is written from one heading and the corpus behind it; a part is
the merge, and merging writes seams and one voice, never a rewrite of a draft.
The introduction is written a beat at a time — five of them — because the beats
have different sources and merging is where they are made to read as one. The
three benchmarking units are three drafts rather than one because they have
different sources, timing and positions in the final text. Excluded works are
not a draft unit — they are a record in `candidates.md`, not a part of the
review.

| Introduction      | `drafts/parts/intro.md`    | drafts 1–5, plus the roadmap paragraph that closes it |
| The nine sections | `drafts/parts/sections.md` | drafts 7–15                                           |

Drafts 6 and 16–18 stand on their own; the metrics primer renders between the
introduction and §1, and the rest close the review.

**The seams between sections are written from the roadmap.** The introduction's
closing paragraph supplies the two-axis logic, and each section's own _Why here_
line supplies the seam into it.

**The conclusion is written last, from the finished parts.** §9 is a coda and
the disclosure beat sets up an ending, but the map states which questions the
conclusion gathers, not what it concludes. Its beats and its ending follow from
the other drafts, so they are decided when those exist rather than planned in
advance.

**Its gaps subsection has a hard rule and it is the map's, not this file's:** a
gap enters only when a publication in the catalog states it. There are four for
that reason, and they are not the place to speculate about what comes next.
Three are limits §1–§9 establish and one is Tables A and B's, which is why the
subsection cannot be drafted before them.

## Relative weight

**Weight follows backbone count, and the count is in the map.** No percentages:
a share to one decimal place is precision the review does not have, and a table
of them gets maintained instead of the argument.

**The one check worth making.** §2 is the heaviest section and §1 next, because
they carry the most backbones; §6, §7 and §9 are the lightest. If a draft comes
back the other way round, the recency inversion has happened, and the fix is to
cut the recent material rather than argue for it. §1–§9 should come to roughly
two thirds of the review, which is right for a review whose argument is the
section order.

## What a section is

A section is a block of argument. It is **not** a list of publications with
commentary on each. Publications appear inside the prose, supporting claims;
they are not headings and they do not each get a turn.

**Its backbones are its subjects; everything else is evidence.** A section with
three backbones has three things to explain properly and a supporting cast.
Prose spent on the cast is prose taken from the subjects — that is the trade,
and it is always the wrong way round when a _mention_ has a sentence to itself.

**Read the entry schema before drafting a section.** `map.md`'s header defines
it: each entry's _Carries_ line is the claim that must survive into the prose,
_Against_ is the comparison the passage should be built around, _Caveat_ travels
with the claim wherever it is cited, and _Collision_ says what this section must
not restate. A backbone passage that states what a system _is_ without stating
what it is **against** has described a paper instead of making an argument.

Every section makes the same four moves, in this order. This is what keeps nine
independently drafted sections reading as one review:

1. **The claim.** What this lineage or technique contributed, stated as a
   proposition. Not a preview of what the section will cover.
1. **The mechanism.** What these models actually do — told once for the whole
   section, from the parsed corpus, rather than restarted for each paper.
1. **The evidence.** Benchmarks and wet-lab campaigns, with the caveat that
   applies to them.
1. **The handoff.** Where the section sits on the coupling spine, and the seam
   into the next section.

**A section draft that could have been written from the map alone has failed.**
The map's own header says what it refuses to hold: _"Method internals, benchmark
numbers, per-paper caveats and quotes are read out of the corpus at writing
time."_ That material is exactly what a section draft is made of, and it comes
from `literature/corpus/`, not from the map entry.

**Collisions are already assigned by the map.** Each draft opens with three
lines — owns / references / must not restate — copied from the map, not
reinvented. The standing assignments: ipTM and pAE definitions to the primer,
ProteinMPNN to §2, AtomWorks to §2 in one line, the trained-critic result to §3,
BoltzDesign1's analysis to §6, the groups-versus-architectures qualification to
§6's step 4, mBER's unchosen-targets argument to the identity beat, the
physical-validity thread and all benchmark caveats to the instruments, and the
disclosure argument to §9.

## Using xrefs

`literature/xrefs.md` answers one question: which paper to read when writing
about another. BoltzProt-1 names BoltzGen 57 times — that is §3's central
comparison, and that passage is where the draft's material is. OpenGerminal
names Germinal 45 times, §6's. Latent-X1 names RFdiffusion 50 times, what §9
measures itself against.

A high count means the papers argue with each other; it never means agreement or
benchmarking, which only reading the passage settles. It is not a sizing
instrument, and never sets a tier. Regenerate with
`uv run scripts/build_xrefs.py` before a drafting pass.

## Assembly

Drafts merge into parts, parts into the review. No pass rewrites a draft.

**The nine sections.** They group as the introduction's roadmap describes: §1–5
ordered by generative formalism, §6–8 by degree of integration, §9 outside the
argument. Assembling them means writing the two block seams and smoothing the
handoffs — not re-editing section bodies.

**The review.** The introduction, then the metrics primer, the nine sections,
the instruments and tables, then the conclusion with its gaps. Scope is argued
in the scope beat; the exclusion log stays in `candidates.md` and is never
drafted.

## Placement directives

Decisions about _where_ material lands and _how_ it must be handled, so the map
stays content.

| Directive                                                                                            | Why                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The metrics primer renders between the introduction and §1, though it belongs with the instruments   | §§1–9 quote pAE, pLDDT, ipTM and PB-valid from the start, and the coupling beat has already raised the question the primer answers              |
| The coupling beat quotes the success criterion without unpacking its units                           | the primer owns the definitions and follows shortly; unpacking them mid-beat stalls the argument                                                |
| The primer is written around the two families of metric, never as an alphabetical glossary           | a metric list is dead weight the reader skips; the families do the analytical work                                                              |
| The Latent-X1 / RFpeptides head-to-head lands under Table B, not §9                                  | so it reads as evidence about measurement, not a point scored for Latent Labs                                                                   |

| Developability and immunogenicity are the gaps subsection's, not §9's                                | Latent-X2 is the evidence but the point is about the field, not about Latent Labs                                                               |
| §2 opens by separating RF3 (predictor) from RFdiffusion3 (generator)                                 | the names collide; the lineage's two tracks are unreadable otherwise                                                                            |
| AtomWorks gets one line, never a passage                                                             | it is training infrastructure, not a model or an instrument; its role is that RF3 and RFdiffusion3 both come out of it                          |
| Level 2 is introduced as the _oldest_ idea in the review, not the newest                             | the §6 arc depends on the reader knowing it was tried and abandoned first                                                                       |
| Table B is sorted by designs-tested, never by hit rate                                               | the denominator is the identity beat's argument; hit-rate order makes it a leaderboard                                                          |
| Table B's hit-definition column is mandatory                                                         | BoltzProt-1's screening-hit / confirmed-binder split means the percentages measure different events                                             |
| No cell enters Table A or B without a stated benchmark, cutoff and measurer                          | the provenance columns are the defence against a leaderboard reading                                                                            |
| Benchmark caveats are stated once with the instruments and pointed at, never relitigated per section | three documented defects, one per prediction instrument, plus Overath's own on the design side                                                  |
| The physical-validity thread is stated once with the instruments                                     | four groups assert four answers and only one pair has been measured against the other; per-section retelling implies more agreement than exists |
